# Geospatial Analysis of the Labor Market in Spain
This project delivers a geospatial analysis of Spain's labor market by combining statistical and geographic data to visualize the regional distribution of job vacancies and employees by economic sector. 

It leverages data analysis and GIS tools to uncover spatial patterns that can support socioeconomic studies or inform policy decisions.

### üîç Project Highlights

#### Data cleaning and exploratory analysis using official open datasets:

- Employees by economic sector and autonomous community (EPA)

- Number of job vacancies by autonomous community

#### Preprocessing of geospatial data from the CNIG Download Center, using QGIS to:

- Extract only the boundaries of autonomous communities.

- Remove unnecessary geographic layers and metadata.

- Optimize the shapefile to improve performance and manageability.
  

#### Geospatial visualization with GeoPandas, overlaying labor data on Spain's map to identify regional trends and disparities.

### üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib

- Jupyter Notebook

- QGIS (for GIS data preprocessing)
